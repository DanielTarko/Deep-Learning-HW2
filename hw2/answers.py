1.1

The input X tesor is (64,1024). The output tensor Y is (64,512).
Therefore, the jacobian of Y with respect to X will be (64, 512, 64, 1024).

1.2

The Jacobian is sparse. Each output batch only depends on the inputs of that batch. So for every index (b1, i, b2, j) such that 0 $\leq$ i $\leq$ 512 and 0 $\leq$ j $\leq$ 1024 and such that b1 $\neq$ b2, the jacobian is zero.
